## 💡 Challenges Faced
| Challenge                         | Solution                                                  |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Flash messages not showing        | Used middleware `res.locals` to share flash messages      |
| Cloudinary deletion of old images | Tracked filename & deleted using Cloudinary API           |
| Filter & search overlap           | Handled separately via dedicated controller & route logic |
| Validation breaking app           | Added centralized Joi error handling middleware           |
| Session issues after login/logout | Ensured proper Passport serialize & deserialize logic     |


## 💬 FAQs & Interview Questions
Q: Why did you choose Passport.js over JWT?
- Passport with sessions fits classic web apps where EJS renders server-side pages; JWT is better for SPAs or APIs.

Q: How do you prevent invalid data?
- Used Joi schema validation and backend sanitation.

Q: Why Cloudinary?
- Handles secure file hosting, image transformations, and easy URL management.

Q: How did you handle categories & search?
- Implemented /search and /filter routes; used regex & query params for flexible filtering.
